# Harmonic Core – Progression Overview

The **Harmonic Core** is the central, semi-sentient entity that drives progression in the gameitem.  
Rather than unlocking content through linear recipes or quests, players advance by **feeding, waiting, and building around** the Core as it evolves over time.

This system is designed to favor **long-term base building, planning, and logistics** over short-term grinding.

## Core's Philosophy

### Time-Locked Progression
> The Core evolves through **phases** (checkpoints). Each phase takes a set amount of real time to charge, and you **cannot rush it**.

### Resource Requirements
> The Core will require specific resources to charge through a phase.  
> - There’s **no penalty** for missing resources. The Core simply **pauses** until you supply them.  

### Phase-Specific Resource Pools
> Each phase draws its requirements from a **unique pool of items**, selected randomly.  
> - Items are divided into **bulk**, **refined**, and **rare** categories.  
> - Depending on what the Core requires, you may automate production or explore the map to gather the necessary items.

### Player Focus
> The gameitem emphasizes **building, farming, and logistics**.  
> - Since there’s no penalty for ignoring the Core, you’re free to play however you like.  
> - Delivering resources efficiently is rewarded: the next phase’s requirements are revealed, allowing you to **plan and automate ahead**.

### Replayability
> Randomized requirements and unique resource pools make every run feel fresh.  
> Your farms, logistics, and base layout will always be a little different.

## Time vs Resources

The Harmonic Core progresses on a **fixed timeline**, but its evolution is **gated by resources**.

- The Core **continues to charge over time**.  
- If required resources are **missing**, progression is **capped** and the Core won’t advance to the next phase.  
- The Core will **pause at that cap** until enough resources are delivered.  
- Once the required resources are provided, progression **immediately resumes**.  
  > If this happens at the end of a phase, the **next phase unlocks instantly**.  
- If resources are delivered early, the Core continues charging, but will **reveal the next phase’s requirements**, allowing you to plan ahead.

This system exists to ensure that:

- **Time** remains the primary progression driver.  
- Players are **never forced to idle**.  
- **Good Preparation and logistics** are rewarded.

## Resource Management

Each phase pulls its requirements from a **phase-specific resource pool**.  

Each item in that pool belongs to one of three categories:

- **Bulk** – Common, farmable materials  
> Example : 10 000 x :gameitem-create-cut_diorite:{ title="create:cut_diorite" } `Cut Diorite block`
- **Refined** – Processed or crafted resources  
> Example : 10 000 x :gameitem-create-cut_diorite:{ title="create:cut_diorite" } `Cut Diorite block`
- **Rare** – Exploration- or progression-gated items  
> Example : 20 x :gameitem-minecraft-deepslate_diamond_ore:{ title="minecraft:deepslate_diamond_ore" } `Deepslate Diamond Ore`

Key points about resource selection:

- Required items are **randomly chosen** from the current phase’s pool.  
- Every playthrough leads to **different farms and logistics**.  
- The **difficulty and theme** of each phase are controlled by its resource pool.
